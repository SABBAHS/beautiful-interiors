# Summary

Beautiful Interiors is a website for a interior designer company. Their services is described in the first page, under a interior design hero image. The targetted audience for this website is for potential clients who are seeking interior design, art consultation and renovation services on their residential properties mainly within the London area. The menu goes on to further detail the services offered, this includes a projects page showcasing a variety of designs through an image gallery. A services page which explains different types of services available such as bathroom renovaion to art restoration and more. Finally, a contact page with a form where users can fill in their contact details, and reason for enquiry in order to hear back from a team member. On this page users can also find the contact details of the company, and a map locating the office. 
<br>
Overall, the website is well designed, with a consistent colour scheme throughout the webpages using dark green, beige and white. The website features hover effects on the navigation bar and gallery images, stylish font styles that area clear to read, a simple to use contact form page and drop down menu with a toggle bar for iPad and Mobile users. 

# Wireframes

Prior to designing the website, I used Cacoo and Balsamic to create wireframes in order to establish the basic structure of the website, to know how to layout the content, to ensure usability is well defined and there is consistency throughout the pages.

# Features

<td><img src=/assets/images/homepage.jpg width=100% height=auto alt="colour and text styles"></td>
<td><img src=assets/images/footer.jpg width=100% height=auto alt="webpage structure"></td>
<ul>
<li>The index page consists of a consistent use of beige, green and white colours.</li>
<li>The logo also acts as a link to the homepage, and beside it to the right is a navigation bar that links to three pages, when hovered over the links on a desktop or laptop the text enlarges.</li>
<li>Hero image is place in the center which zooms in when users open the webpage. A slogan is seen at the bottom left on larger screens.
<li> A footer is consistently shown on every page with a similar colour scheme, linking it to four social media accounts with a copyright text just under it</li>
</ul>

</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td><td><img src=assets/images/projects-page.jpg width=100% height=auto alt="Projects Page"></td>
<ul>
<li>The projects page features a gallery of nine photographs of various interior design styles from bedroom to home office designs.</li> 
<li>On larger screens their is a hover feature, where the background blurs and a text detailing the imagery appears.</li>
<li>Using flexbox, the images were able to appear to be more inline and centered, also sizing down evenly as the size of the screen reduces.</li>
</ul>

<td><img src=assets/images/mobile-services.jpg width=100% height=auto alt="Services page as mobile view"></td>
<ul>
<li> The services pages is where users can find an overview of the companies services listed in an organised fashion, with clear and concise wording so that anyone who is not a professional designer can understand.</li>
<li>As drawn out in the wireframe, for larger screens the design cosists of two images in each row with a text box in the middle.</li>
<li> For mobile view, the best way to achieve a cleaner aesthetic was to hide every second photo. The result as shows is one image per text box which is stacking on top of each other.</li>
</ul>

<li>A text box below the form features three key contact information such as a number, address and email address with accompanied fontawesome icons for users that prefer to contact the company another way. Under this is a embedded map which makes this page more interactive and engaging</li>
<li> As shown in the screenshots on the far right, on the mobile view has hidden the input field for users surname and mobile number in order to keep it short and concise.</li>
<li>When the screen size reduced to an iPad and mobile view, users will find a burger toggle button on the top right corner beside the logo. This drops down a menu with the three other pages, when clicked, the link displays an underline before opening the new page.</li>

## Features left to impement

A few other page ideas included: client reviews, meet the team, how it works and pricing packages. However, to keep things straightforward, I've kept three most important areas potential clients would expect to see on a interior designers website.

<li><span style="color:green">Yout-tube</span></li>
I searched for tutorials on how to add a favicon, and toggle bar from You-tube.


# Testing

## Browsers and Screen sizes
- Ive confirmed that this project looks good on different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- Ive confirmed the the pages are all responsive, and look good on large screen sizes (1600px, 1200px), laptop (1200px, 1050px), iPad (768px) and Mobile sizes (430px, 390px, 320px).
- I've carried out extensive testing on multiple browsers to ensure all key elements such as the heading, images, footer icons, navigation links are size appropriate. 
- I've confirmed text is readable, the images are not stretched and the colour scheme does not clash or cause any issues to the users ability to smoothly navigate around the web.
- Here are some of the key areas: using flexbox on the projects page effectively placed images evenly as the screen reduces, the services page was rearranged to have only one image stack on top of each text box, and on the contacts page two unnecessary input fields were removed in order to be more size appropriate for the new screen size. 
- I've confirmed that the website is easy to navigate for a user, the menu works.
- I've confirmed that the form and submit button works. The form has required fields where the user is prompted to have filled before sending the form, and that the mobile field only allows numbers, and the email field prompts the user if an @ is missing.
  
## Bugs encountered 
  
- I followed a tutorial online to add a burger toggle as a dropdown menu. Whilst this was working fine, the W3 validator flagged this as an error, which was that the 'a' was not allowed as child of element 'ul' in the context it was in. I placed the 'a' inside the 'li' which helped resolve the issue. 
- Earlier in the project none of the images or elements would appear, even after a hours of refreshing and searching for bugs on devtools and using validators, eventually no bugs were found which lead to opening a new workspace.
- I initially had 21 images in my projects gallery, however the load time was very slow. During my mid-project review, my mentor Rahul suggested to stick to 9 images and apply a hover feature to make the gallery more interactive. Using Lighthouse, I saw the performance improved by 10% by reducing the images. 


## Bugs left unfixed
On the Projects page, for smaller screens such as mobile and laptop users should be able to click on the images to see the effect of image blurring and revealing a text box. This only works if the user presses down on the image, which from a user perspective is unlikely. I have applied several coding suggestions through stackoverflow, such as adding 'onclick=""' and ontouchstart="", however these end up being applied to all sites which it not ideal. I've tried to test this on devtools which will always show that it is working, its only been tested on Iphones. I did have tutor support, however they were unable to assist in getting this to work. 

## Validation 

- I've confirmed that no errors were flagged when passing all pages of my HTML code by direct input through the [official W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- I've confirmed that no errors were flagged when passing my CSS code by direct input through the [official Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

# Credits

- As simple as the burger toggle appears, I had followed two different tutorials that included javscript, however my tutor was able to assist in helping me find a tutorial that was simpler to implement which was this one: https://dev.to/ljcdev/hamburger-css-no-js-2dfa. I had to change the code to have it validated. Thank you to Jason at CodeIntitute for helping me with this.
- I had attempted these two prior to that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg and https://codepen.io/gjsayers/pen/ExEwGWw. 
- Thanks to my mentor for sending me this game: https://flexboxfroggy.com/, it helped in understanding and applying flexbox into my project. 
- On the projects page, I wanted a feature that pops up text as you hover over the image. The code that I applied here was inspired from this website: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp.
- Although this was taught on the course, I could not get the favicon to work, so I got it work through following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEf1xSwX5D8.
