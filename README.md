# Summary

Beautiful Interiors is a website for an interior designer company. Their services are described on the first page, under the hero image, with two videos relating to interior design. The audience for this website are seeking interior design, art consultation and renovation services on their residential properties mainly within the London area. The menu goes on to further detail the services offered, this includes a projects page showcasing a variety of designs through an image gallery. A services page that explains different types of services available such as bathroom renovation, art restoration and more. Finally, a contact page with a form where users can fill in their contact details, and reason for enquiry to hear back from a team member. On this page, users can also find the contact details of the company, and a map locating the office. 
<br>
Overall, the website is well designed, with a consistent colour scheme throughout the web pages using dark green, beige and white. The website features hover effects on the navigation bar and gallery images, stylish font styles that are clear to read, a simple-to-use contact form page and drop-down menu with a toggle bar for iPad and Mobile users. 

# Wireframes

Before designing the website, I used Cacoo and Balsamic to create wireframes to establish the basic structure of the website to know how to layout the content and colour scheme, and to ensure usability is well-defined and there is consistency throughout the pages. Below are some examples of the wireframes for the homepage, services page, mobile view, and contacts page, I did not want it to be too detailed as I wanted to play around with different styles, however due to time contraints, and good usability a basic structure is necessary.

<ul>
<li>The index page consists of a consistent use of beige, green and white colours.</li>
<li>The logo also acts as a link to the homepage, and beside it to the right is a navigation bar that links to three pages, when hovered over the links on a desktop or laptop the text changes colour to grey.</li>
<li>Hero image is placed in the center which zooms in when users open the webpage. A slogan is seen at the bottom left on larger screens.
<li>Two YouTube videos are placed on the homepage which adds more functionality and content to the  homepage. 
<li> A footer is consistently shown on every page with a similar colour scheme, linking it to four social media accounts. The copyright is intentionally placed for up to 430px as it did not look good on smaller screens.</li>
</ul>

<table>
<tr>
<td><td><img src=assets/images/projects-page.jpg width=100% height=auto alt="Projects Page"></td>
<ul>
<li>The projects page features a gallery of nine photographs of various interior design styles from bedroom to home office designs.</li> 
<li>On larger screens there is a hover feature, where the background blurs and a text detailing the imagery appears.</li>
<li>Using flexbox, the images were able to appear to be more inline and centered, also sizing down evenly as the size of the screen reduces.</li>
</ul>

<td><img src=assets/images/mobile-services.jpg width=100% height=auto alt="Services page as mobile view"></td>
<ul>
<li> The services pages is where users can find an overview of the companies services listed in an organised fashion, with clear and concise wording so that anyone who is not a professional designer can understand.</li>
<li>As drawn out in the wireframe, for larger screens the design consists of two images in each row with a text box in the middle.</li>
<li> For mobile view, the best way to achieve a cleaner aesthetic was to hide every second photo. The result as shown is one image per text box which is stacked on top of each other.</li>

<ul>
<li> The contacts page is designed for users to leave their name, email, phone number, and reason for contact to hear back from the company. Using form validation, the user will receive a notification if any required fields have not been entered.</li>
<li>A text box below the form features three key contact information such as a number, address and email address with accompanied fontawesome icons for users that prefer to contact the company another way. Under this is an embedded map which makes this page more interactive and engaging</li>
<li> As shown in the screenshots on the far right, the mobile view has hidden the input field for user surname and mobile number to keep it short.</li>
<li>When the screen size is reduced to an iPad and mobile view, users will find a burger toggle button on the top right corner beside the logo. This drops down a menu with the three other pages, when clicked, the link displays an underline before opening the new page.</li>
</ul>

## Features for the future 

A few more page ideas include: client reviews, meet the team, how it works and pricing packages. However, to keep things straightforward, I've kept the three most important areas potential clients would expect to see on an interior designers website.

# Testing

## Browsers and Screen sizes
- I've confirmed that this project looks good on different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- I've confirmed that the pages are all responsive, and look good on large screen sizes (1600px, 1200px), laptop (1200px, 1050px), iPad (768px) and Mobile sizes (430px, 390px, 320px).
- I've carried out extensive testing on multiple browsers to ensure all key elements such as the heading, images, footer icons, and navigation links are size-appropriate. 
- I've confirmed text is readable, the images are not stretched and the colour scheme does not clash or cause any issues to the user's ability to smoothly navigate around the web.
- Here are some of the key areas: using flexbox on the projects page effectively places images evenly as the screen reduces, the services page was rearranged to have only one image stack on top of each text box, and on the contacts page two unnecessary input fields were removed to be more size appropriate for the new screen size. 
- I've confirmed that the website is easy to navigate for a user, the menu works.
- I've confirmed that the form and submit button works. The form has required fields that the user is prompted to have filled before sending the form, the mobile field only allows numbers, and the email field prompts the user if an @ is missing.
  
## Bugs encountered 
  
- I followed a tutorial online to add a burger toggle as a dropdown menu. Whilst this was working fine, the W3 validator flagged this as an error, which was that the 'a' was not allowed as a child of element 'ul' in the context it was in. I placed the 'a' inside the 'li' which helped resolve the issue. 
- Earlier in the project none of the images or elements would appear, even after hours of refreshing and searching for bugs on dev tools and using validators, eventually no bugs were found which led to the opening of a new workspace.
- I initially had 21 images in my projects gallery, however, the load time was very slow. During my mid-project review, my mentor Rahul suggested sticking to 9 images and applying a hover feature to make the gallery more interactive. Using Lighthouse, I saw the performance improved by 10% by reducing the images. 


## Bugs left unfixed
On the Projects page, for smaller screens such as mobile and laptop users should be able to click on the images to see the effect of image blurring and revealing a text box. This only works if the user presses down on the image, which from a user perspective is unlikely. I have applied several coding suggestions through Stackoverflow, such as adding 'onclick=""' and ontouchstart="", however, these ended up being applied to all sites which it not ideal. I've tried to test this on dev tools which will always show that it is working, it's only been tested on iPhones. I did have tutor support, however, they were unable to assist in getting this to work. 

## Validation 

- I've confirmed that no errors were flagged when passing all pages of my HTML code by direct input through the [official W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- I've confirmed that no errors were flagged when passing my CSS code by direct input through the [official Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

# Credits

- As simple as the burger toggle appears, I had followed two different tutorials that included javscript, however my tutor was able to assist in helping me find a tutorial that was simpler to implement which was this one: https://dev.to/ljcdev/hamburger-css-no-js-2dfa. I had to change the code to have it validated. Thank you to Jason at CodeIntitute for helping me with this.
- I had attempted these two before that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg and https://codepen.io/gjsayers/pen/ExEwGWw. 
- Thanks to my mentor for sending me this game: https://flexboxfroggy.com/, it helped me to understand and apply flexbox into my project. 
- On the projects page, I wanted a feature that pops up text as you hover over the image. The code that I applied here was inspired by this website: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp.
- Although this was taught on the course, I could not get the favicon to work, so I got it work through following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEf1xSwX5D8.

# Deployment
To deploy my webpage, I took the following steps:
1. head to the web page's repository, and select 'settings'
2. from settings, select 'pages' on the left-hand corner
3. Under Source select 'deploy from branch'
4. Under Branch select the publishing source, in my case I've selected 'main' and '/(root)', then click save
5. After a few seconds, and refreshing the webpage, I was able to see a link to my website on the top of the webpage.
6. Using git commit and git push to send my changes to GitHub I was able to see any changes made to the website.
   
The site was deployed to github and can be found here: https://sabbahs.github.io/beautiful-interiors/
